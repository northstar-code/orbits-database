cant guarantee integration tolerances will be great. I usually integrate to 1e-12 but sometimes it's worse. But also sometimes it's better, so you never know what you're gonna get. It's like a box of chocolates that way.

Unless specified otherwise, mu=1.215058560962404e-2 (stolen from JPL a while ago).
